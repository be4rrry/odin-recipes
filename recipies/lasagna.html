    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a cat's favorite food according to Jim Davis. 
        Originally from ancient Greece, lasagna has been a household favorite of my 
        family's for a long time. Although I can't stand the shit, I'm adding it here, 
        since TOP had a sample of lasagna. Frankly, I'm too lazy to change to another 
        recipe that I acctually like.

    <p>
        I do understand that I'll probably get some shade for not liking lasagna, 
        but think of it this way, there are <em>MUCH</em> better italian dishes. 
        I also know that I just said that it was an ancient Greek dish, but man, 
        I have no clue how that works. People make mistakes sometimes, and if you 
        want to argue the orgination of lasagna with someone who doesn't even like 
        the dish, that's your own problem. Anyway, here's how you make the 
        rancid catfood.

        <li>1 1/2 tsp dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp italian seasonings</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 tbsp chropped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 oz ricotta</li>
        <lI>1 egg</lI>
        <li>3/4 lb sliced mozz</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated parm</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large dutch oven, cook your
            sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic on medium head until fragrant and 
            brown. Add in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and some water. 
            Add your seasonings, listed below. Simmer, while covered, for about an hour 
            and a half, making sure to stir every now and then.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large, liberally salted pot of water to a boil. Cook the noods for
            about 8-10 mins. Drain the noods, and rinse them with cold water. In a bowl
            add the ricoota with egg, parsley, and 1/2 tsp salt. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble by spreading the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 in baking dish.
            Arrange 6 noods over the meat sauce. Spead with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture.
            Top with 1/3 of the mozz cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of the meaty sauce
            over the mozz, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of parm. Repeat until out of stuff.
            Cover it with foil. Spray with cooking spray to stop sticking, or don't touch 
            foil to cheese >:(
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 25 mins. Remove foil, and bake for 25 more mins. Let it cool 
            before eating. I am not responsible for burnt tongues. Or anything else 
            burnt for that matter.
        </li>
    </ol>
