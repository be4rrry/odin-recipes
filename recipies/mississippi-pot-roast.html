    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Being from Mississippi, this Mississippi Pot Roast
        is close to my heart. Although I didn't start making 
        until I was out of college, I had it a good amount
        growing up. The amount of grease, fat, oil, and soul
        that goes into this dish makes enough sense as to why
        it's named after Mississippi.

        There are a lot of other things you can add to this 
        recipe as well. Some people put it on a sandwich, which
        personally, I am not crazy about. I like it was some
        potatoes and carrots, but others like it with some greens
        or just a whole 'nother stick of butter on the side.
        Anyway, let's get to how to make this dish.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3-5 lbs of chuck roast</li>
        <li>
            6-infinite pepperochinis - I like mine hot, 
            but the original recipe I followed called for 6.
            Now that is some weak stuff, so at least add about 10
            if you're really want some good stuff.
        </li>
        <li>1 packet of ranch mix</li>
        <li>1 packet of au jus gravy mix</li>
        <li>1 stick of butter</li>
        <li>(Optional) Yukon Gold Potatoes/Baby Red Potatoes</li>
        <li>(Optional) Baby Carrots</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine all in crock pot, and set on low for 8-10 hours.
        </li>
